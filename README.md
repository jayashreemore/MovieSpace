- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

==============
You can try Batman , Superman ...any movies list and get details of any movie like name, directorname, starcast and release date of the movie

In App.js:

useState is used to manage the state of movies and searchTerm.
useEffect is used to trigger the initial search for movies when the component mounts.

In MovieCard.jsx:

useState is used to manage the state of isOpen (to control the modal) and details (to store additional movie details fetched from the API).
useEffect is not used directly in MovieCard.jsx, but it's utilized within the openModal function to fetch additional movie details when the modal is opened.
